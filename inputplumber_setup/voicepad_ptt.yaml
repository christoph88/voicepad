description: Route back paddle R4 to DBus for voice command PTT

# Map R4 back paddle to DBus target
# Note: R4 when unmapped may not generate events, so we'll intercept ALL
# events and filter for R4 in Python
mapping: []

# This profile enables intercept mode to route events to DBus
# Your Python script will listen to DBus events and filter for R4
